This is my first project in NLP. This is a classification task where a news article has to classify in real or fake one.

I have use mutliple techniques such as lemmitization, stemming, Count vectorizer and Tfidf (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorizer. There are two models, I have use in this project: 1) Naive Bias 2) Passive Aggressive Classifier.

I have got the best accuracy of 99.8 % using stemming, Tfidf Vectorizer and Passive Aggresive Classifier.
