This a project I choose to learn about AWS and use it.

In this project, the script scraps covid 19 data of 10 specified contries from WorldMeter website. And also the data is added to the google sheets. Using AWS lambda and CloudWatch the above script is set to run everyday at exactly (9:00 PM) IST.
