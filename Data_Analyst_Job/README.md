This project is a bigginer friendly Data Analyse and Visualization projects using Python.

This is a self project I have done after exploring kaggle a bit and getting curious about the dataset.
Data obtain from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/data-analyst-jobs). 

I have use pandas, matplotlib and seaborn python libraries. I have ploted multiple bar plots, wordcount and histograms to analyse the data. 
This project is also been submitted on kaggle. You can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hpoddar2810/data-analyst-job-analysis)
