### Discription
This is a project I have done out of my curiosity and to learn SQL. In this projects I have extract multiple information regarding the covid 19 cases, deaths and vaccination in multiple countries.

Data is obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. They update the data on daily basis. As I had downloaded it on 8th July, The dataset have data till 7th July, 2021 with daily frequency for each contries. The dataset site contains the whole data in one excel only, but I have divided it into two diffrent excel files (covidDeaths, covidVaccination). 

Data of this project is in two excel files.(covidDeaths.xlsx, covidVaccinations.xlsx)

In this project, I have written multiple SQL queries to analyse Covid-19 cases and vaccinations in multiple contries and continents. I am doing this project on my Windows 10 laptop with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
